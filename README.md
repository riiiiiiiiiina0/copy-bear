## What is Copy Bear?

**Copy Bear** is your cuddly Chrome sidekick for copying page titles and URLs. With just one paw (okay, click), Copy Bear grabs the info you need and hands it over in your favorite style—plain text, markdown, and more! No more clumsy typing or awkward “what was that link again?” moments.

Copy Bear makes research, writing, and sharing as easy as stealing honey from a picnic basket. 🍯
