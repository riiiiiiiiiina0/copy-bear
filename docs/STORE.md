🐻 Copy Bear — One‑click custom copy for your tabs

Copy Bear has one job, and it does it adorably well: copy your selected tab(s) title, URL, and any selected text in your favorite custom format — with just one click.

✨ What you can do
- One‑click copy: Hit the toolbar button and your neatly formatted text is ready to paste.
- Your format, your rules: Use placeholders like <title>, <url>, <quote>, and \n to shape the output.
- Copy many tabs at once: Select multiple tabs, then click — Copy Bear gathers them all.
- Include selected text: Highlight text on a page to include it as <quote> automatically.
- Quick shortcut: Cmd+Shift+1 (macOS) or Ctrl+Shift+1 (Windows/Linux).
- Page title preprocessing rules: Apply custom transformations to the page title before copying it into your clipboard. Create automation rules to modify titles (such as trimming, replacing, or reformatting) to fit your workflow.
